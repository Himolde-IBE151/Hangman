Preparing for the Hangman Game II

*Objective: To know how to use the length of the string to index the last character in s. To be able to take decisions according to the character in a position in the string*
### Exercise: 
**Save your name in the variable s. Input a letter and assign it to the variable v. If the letter entered is the last character in s, print "You wrote the last letter of my name". Note that the next code have instructions missing that you will have to add.**
*In the next code, replace "My Name" by your name.*
```python
# write the commands missing here
s = "My Name"
if (s[len(s)-1] == v):
    print("You wrote the last letter of my name")
```

### Exercise:(Game) 
**Guess a letter inside a word.**
We have fixed a secret word (a string) in your program. For instance 
```python
secretWord = "Orangutan"
```
In this game, the user have to guess one of the letters of a secret word that we have fixed in our program. 
The program inputs from the user **1 character** s and then the **position** p where (s)he guesses the character appears in the secret word (**remember that positions start from 0**). 
If (s)he succeds, the program prints "Success, you won!" otherwise prints "You lost!" 

**Try to solve the problem by yourself.** Then you can verify your answer [here](./hangman.py)
You can use emojis in your program. [Here](./funnyEmojis.py) you can see how to print some of them.

### Exercise: 
**Given a secretWord (a string), print 3 '_' for every character in the secret word (preparation for the Hangman game). For instance, if the secretWord is "Sky" the program should print:**
```
___ ___ ___
```
(3 '_' for every character)

Hint: use a for loop, like in 
```python
for i in range(10):
```
### Exercise: 
**Input a string s. Print all the characters in s separated by 3 spaces.** 
Hint: use a for loop

### Exercise: 
**Input a string s and a character c. Print how many times c appears in s.**
**Try to solve the problem by yourself.** Then you can verify your answer [here](./counter.py)

### Exercise: 
**Verify if a character appears in a word. Input a word s and a character c. If the character appears in the word, print("Found it!"). Otherwise, print(Not found")**
Hint: use a for loop and search for c character by character in s
