# Design of the Hangman Game
In this assignment you will implement the **Hangman game**. Do not rush to write your program yet! We will spend some time thinking about the program, the inputs, outputs, the specification and then on the process itself and how it can be broken in smaller/easier to think about pieces. Only then we will implement it.

## Design
```diff
 Inputs:
 secret_word : generated by words as words.get_words()
 N : max amount of characters the user can enter before losing the game
 a sequence of characters, one by one until the word is guesses or the amount of characters == N
 Output: is the whole word is guessed: " You won! ðŸ˜€" otherwise: " You lost! ðŸ˜¢"
 
# Game: 
 Get secret word. 
 Initialization  
 Play until finish. 
   if word is guessed: 
       " You won! ðŸ˜€" otherwise: " You lost! ðŸ˜¢"
```
```diff
 Get secret_word
 Initialization
# Execution loop: 
- #Play until finish
+ repeat N times --> I need initialize N as the max number of attempts
-     #if word is guessed:
+     read a letter
+     process the letter. 
+.    verify win condition. If true output success and exit 
+     initialize next iteration 
  endloop  
```
```diff
  Get secret_word
- Initialization
+ Initialize variables:
+ N : max number of attempts
+ Print word as: first letter in secret word + " ___" for every letter left in secret_word
  repeat N times
      read a letter c <-- in the future we would check if this was a letter and only one, and that was not entered before, and transform it in lowercase, etc. Not in this assignment
-     #process the letter  
+     check if the letter is in the secret_word. (need to keep a record of the letters entered and their position:better in a word!-> word_in_progress) 
+         update word_in_progress (remember to initialize!)
-.        #verify win condition. If true output success and exit  
+         verify if the word_in_progress == secret_word, in that case: output success and exit    
+         otherwise letter is not in the secret_word --> handle it
      initialize next iteration

  Print word as: first letter in secret word + " ___" for every letter left in secret_word

 -       otherwise letter is not in the secret_word --> handle it
 +       if not found print how many attempts got left <-- track how many attempts already (remember initialize attempt = 1)
      initialize next iteration 
  endloop
