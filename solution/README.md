# Design of the Hangman Game
In this assignment you will implement the **Hangman game**. Do not rush to write your program yet! We will spend some time thinking about the program, the inputs, outputs, the specification and then on the process itself and how it can be broken in smaller/easier to think about pieces. Only then we will implement it.

## Design
```diff
- text in red
+ text in green
! text in orange
# text in gray
```
```diff
+ Inputs
+ secret_word : generated by words as words.get_words()
+ N : max amount of characters the user can enter before losing the game
+ a sequence of characters, one by one until the word is guesses or the amount of characters == N

+ Output: is the whole word is guessed: " You won! ðŸ˜€" otherwise: " You lost! ðŸ˜¢"

# Game: 
+          inputs secret word. 
+          Initialization  
#          Play until finish. 
#             if word is guessed: 
+                " You won! ðŸ˜€" otherwise: " You lost! ðŸ˜¢"
#
```
```python
#        generate secret_word
#        Initialize variables. N is the max number of attempts
# Execution loop: 
-          #Play until finish
+          repeat N times
-             #if word is guessed:
+             read a letter
+             process the letter, if the word is complete: success and exit          
#          endloop
#          
```

#             #process the letter, if the word is complete: success and exit  
#                check if the letter is in the secret_word. keep a record of the letters entered and their position. better in a word! -> update word_in_progress (remember to initialize!)
#                verify if the word_in_progress == secret_word, in that case: success and exit

#               That is secret_word[0] + "_"*(len(secret_word) - 1) <-- we need to substract 1 because we already have the first letter
#          repeat until N + 1
#             read a letter c <-- in the future we would check if this was a letter, and only one, and that was not entered before, and transform it in lowercase, etc. Not in this assignment
#             update word_in_progress: 
#                    find the right position for the letter in secret_word if that is the case and update word_in_progress in every appearance of the letter
